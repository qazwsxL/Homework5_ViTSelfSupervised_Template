#  TASK 0: Attention map visualization
#
#  Visualize what ViT attention heads "look at."
#  We extract [class]-to-patch attention from the last transformer layer
#  and display it in two styles: fade-to-black and grayscale heatmaps.
#  This function is reused throughout the homework (Tasks 0, 3, 4).
# ========================================================================

# Part A: Visualize attention maps
#
def visualize_attention(model, image_tensor, save_path, style='fade', device='cpu'):
    """Extract and visualize [class]-to-patch attention from a ViT.

    This function does two things:
      1. Extract attention: call get_attention_weights() to get the raw
         (num_heads, num_tokens, num_tokens) matrix from the last layer,
         then pull out [class]'s attention to each patch and reshape to 2D.
      2. Visualize: display the original image alongside per-head attention maps.

    Two visualization styles:
        'gray'  -- Nearest-neighbor upsample (preserves pixelated patch grid),
                   display as grayscale.  (Caron et al. DINO style)
        'fade'  -- Bilinear upsample to image resolution, multiply image by
                   attention. High-attention areas stay visible; low-attention
                   areas fade to black.  (Dosovitskiy et al. style)

    Rescaling for display: 
    Each head's [class]-to-patch attention is a probability distribution (softmax), 
    so the values sum to 1 across all patches. But, suppose we have a 
    14x14 = 196 patch grid, then a uniform attention gives ~0.005 per patch — 
    nearly black. Even a head that focuses on a single region might peak at 0.1. 
    
    To make the patterns visible, we can rescale each head's attention to [0, 1] 
    via (a - a.min()) / (a.max() - a.min()). This stretches whatever variation 
    exists to fill the display range. Note that this means a nearly-uniform head 
    can look structured — compare the range (max - min) across heads to judge 
    which are truly selective.

    Arguments:
        model        -- a timm ViT model (e.g., from create_vit_tiny())
        image_tensor -- (1, 3, H, W) tensor, values in [0, 1]
        save_path    -- where to save the PNG
        style        -- 'fade' or 'gray'
        device       -- torch device

    Hints:
        - get_attention_weights(model, image_tensor, device) returns shape
          (num_heads, num_tokens, num_tokens). Token 0 is [class].
        - model.num_prefix_tokens tells you how many non-patch tokens (usually 1).
        - For a 224px image with 16px patches: 14x14 = 196 patches.
        - Use F.interpolate to upsample, mode='bilinear' or mode='nearest'.

    #   2. Extract [class] row: attn[:, 0, num_prefix:]
    #      -> (num_heads, num_patches)
    #   3. Reshape to 2D grid. The grid shape depends on the image size:
    #          H_img, W_img = image_tensor.shape[2], image_tensor.shape[3]
    #          patch_size = 16  # ViT-Tiny uses 16x16 patches

    # TODO: Implement the DINO training loop. See the handout diagram.
    #
    #   Setup:
    #   1. Create student ViTEncoder with a 3-layer MLP projection head:
    #      e.g., 
    #      Linear(192, hidden) -> ReLU -> Linear(hidden, hidden) -> ReLU -> Linear(hidden, K)
    #      where hidden = hp.DINO_HIDDEN_DIM and K = hp.DINO_OUT_DIM.
    #
    #      - Using an MLP is critical — a single Linear head causes immediate collapse.
    #      - The DINO paper uses GeLU activations (a smooth fancier ReLU)
    #      - Choice of K is important -> we set it at 256 but smaller may give better results
    #        Training DINO on large data uses much larger K, e.g., 65,556
    #
    #   2. Create teacher as a frozen deep copy of the student (no gradients).
    #
    #   3. Create an optimizer.
    #
    #   4. Create a DataLoader for the multi-crop data.
    #      Normally, DataLoader's default collate stacks all samples into a
    #      single tensor via torch.stack. But here each sample is a list of
    #      crops with different sizes (224x224 globals + 96x96 locals), so
    #      stacking fails. However, the collate_fn input to DataLoader can 
    #      receive a list of samples and return a batch; so, we can use it:
    #      passing collate_fn=list makes it return the samples as-is 
    #      (list in, list out), skipping the stacking step.
    #
    #   Training loop (for each epoch, for each batch):
    #   5. Forward the teacher on global crops only (first 2), with no gradients.
    #      Forward the student on all crops (global + local).
    #
    #   6. DINO loss: for each cross-view pair (teacher crop i, student crop j,
    #      skipping i == j), compute cross-entropy where the target distribution
    #      is the teacher's sharpened softmax (divided by teacher_temp)
    #      and the predicted distribution is the student's sharpened softmax
    #      (divided by student_temp — less sharp than the teacher's).
    #      Average over all valid pairs.
    #      Remember: there is no gradient back from the loss for the teacher, so
    #      .detatch() on the teacher's softmax to prevent backprop through it.
    #
    #   7. Backprop and optimizer step.
    #
    #   8. EMA update: for each parameter pair,
    #      teacher = momentum * teacher + (1 - momentum) * student
    #
    #   After each epoch:
    #   9. Print average loss and call the dashboard:
    #       dashboard.update(epoch, avg_loss, student_out[0].detach(),
    #                        teacher_out[0].detach(),
    #                        center=torch.zeros(hp.DINO_OUT_DIM),

    #                        ema_momentum=hp.DINO_EMA_MOMENTUM)
    #
    #   After training:
    #  10. Save encoder weights to approaches['dino'].weights
    #  11. Save loss curve to approaches['dino'].curve_train
    #  12. Call dashboard.save_attention_evolution()
    #  13. Visualize final attention maps using your visualize_attention():
